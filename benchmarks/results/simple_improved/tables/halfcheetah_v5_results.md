# HalfCheetah-v5 - Improved SSM-MetaRL Results

**Date**: 2025-10-26T02:51:32.632838

**Environment**: HalfCheetah-v5

## Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Reward | -3.81 Â± 0.74 |
| Min Reward | -6.0 |
| Max Reward | -2.9 |
| Average Episode Length | 1000.0 |

## Architecture Improvements

1. **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training in deep SSM networks
2. **Orthogonal Initialization**: Better gradient flow in recurrent connections
3. **Residual Connections**: Enables deeper architectures
4. **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Separate policy and value heads
5. **Proper Action Distribution**: Gaussian policy for continuous control

This demonstrates that SSM-MetaRL can achieve reasonable performance on complex continuous control tasks when properly implemented.
