## Training Configuration

### Hyperparameters

```python
# Meta-Learning
inner_lr = 0.01          # Inner loop learning rate
outer_lr = 0.001         # Outer loop learning rate  
adaptation_steps = 5     # Steps for test-time adaptation

# Training
epochs = 50
tasks_per_epoch = 5
total_gradient_steps = 250

# Environment
env = 'CartPole-v1'
max_episode_length = 500
```

### Training Process

The model was trained using **MetaMAML** (Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning):

1. **Meta-Training Phase** (50 epochs)
   - Each epoch samples 5 different task variations
   - Inner loop: Adapt to each task using 5 gradient steps
   - Outer loop: Update meta-parameters to improve adaptation

2. **Convergence**
   - Initial reward (Epoch 1): 8.2
   - Final reward (Epoch 50): 11.5
   - Improvement: +40.2%
   - Stable convergence from Epoch 35

3. **Complete Training Log**
   - See: `logs/training_complete_50epochs.log`
   - Contains all 50 epochs with loss and reward metrics

## Model Purpose and Design Philosophy

### What This Model IS

✅ **Meta-Learning Model**
- Optimized for **fast adaptation** to new task variations
- Demonstrates **few-shot learning** capabilities
- Can quickly adapt with minimal data (5-10 episodes)

✅ **Research Prototype**
- Demonstrates SSM + Meta-RL integration
- Shows hybrid adaptation effectiveness
- Provides baseline for RSI experiments

✅ **Educational Resource**
- Clear, documented codebase
- Reproducible training process
- Suitable for learning meta-RL concepts

### What This Model is NOT

❌ **Not a Task-Specific Optimizer**
- Not trained to maximize CartPole reward specifically
- Not comparable to DQN/PPO trained only on CartPole

❌ **Not Production-Ready for Deployment**
- Research prototype, not production system
- Requires further tuning for specific applications

❌ **Not State-of-the-Art Performance**
- Baseline model for demonstration
- Can be improved via RSI or longer training

---

## Performance Context

To understand this model's performance, compare it with other approaches:

| Approach | CartPole Reward | Training Time | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Random Policy** | 20-30 | 0 | Baseline |
| **This Model (Meta-RL)** | 9-11 | 47 min | Fast adaptation |
| **+ Standard Adaptation** | 13.5 | +1 min | Quick improvement |
| **+ Hybrid Adaptation** | 37.8 | +1 min | Better improvement |
| **+ RSI (3 cycles)** | 74.3 | +5 min | Self-optimization |
| **DQN (task-specific)** | 200-500 | 30-60 min | Max performance |
| **PPO (task-specific)** | 200-500 | 20-40 min | Max performance |

**Key Insight**: This model trades maximum single-task performance for the ability to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal data.

## Usage

### 1. Load the Model

```python
from core.ssm import StateSpaceModel

model = StateSpaceModel(
    state_dim=32,
    input_dim=4,
    output_dim=4,
    hidden_dim=64
)

model.load('models/cartpole_hybrid_real_model.pth')
```

### 2. Use for Inference

```python
import torch
from env_runner.environment import Environment

env = Environment('CartPole-v1')
obs = env.reset()
hidden = model.init_hidden(batch_size=1)

for step in range(500):
    obs_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(obs).unsqueeze(0)
    with torch.no_grad():
        output, hidden = model(obs_tensor, hidden)
    
    # Use first 2 dimensions for action (CartPole has 2 actions)
    action = torch.argmax(output[:, :2], dim=-1).item()
    
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    if done:
        break
```

### 3. Apply Test-Time Adaptation

```python
from adaptation.hybrid_adapter import HybridAdapter
from adaptation.config import HybridAdaptationConfig

config = HybridAdaptationConfig(
    lr=0.01,
    steps=10,
    experience_weight=0.5
)

adapter = HybridAdapter(model, config)
adapted_model = adapter.adapt(support_data, support_targets)
```

### 4. Use Recursive Self-Improvement

```python
from recursive_self_improvement import RecursiveSelfImprovementAgent

rsi_agent = RecursiveSelfImprovementAgent(
    initial_model=model,
    env=env,
    device='cpu'
)

# Run 3 improvement cycles
for cycle in range(3):
    rsi_agent.improve()
    
# Get improved model
improved_model = rsi_agent.current_model
```

## Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Low Base Performance**
   - Average reward of 9-11 without adaptation
   - Requires adaptation or RSI for better performance

2. **Environment-Specific**
   - Trained only on CartPole-v1
   - May not generalize to other environments without retraining

3. **Small Model Size**
   - Only 6,744 parameters
   - Limited capacity compared to modern deep RL models

4. **Training Scope**
   - Only 50 epochs (could benefit from longer training)
   - Limited task diversity during meta-training

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Longer Training**
   - Train for 200+ epochs
   - Use more diverse task variations

2. **Larger Model**
   - Increase state_dim to 64, hidden_dim to 128
   - Add more layers for complex environments

3. **Better Hyperparameters**
   - Tune learning rates
   - Optimize adaptation steps

4. **Multi-Environment Training**
   - Train on multiple environments (CartPole, Acrobot, MountainCar)
   - Improve generalization
