## How to Use the Generated Model

### 1. Loading the Model

```python
from core.ssm import StateSpaceModel

# Initialize model architecture
model = StateSpaceModel(
    state_dim=32,
    input_dim=4,
    output_dim=4,
    hidden_dim=64
)

# Load trained weights
model.load("cartpole_hybrid_real_model.pth")
model.eval()
```

### 2. Running Inference

```python
import torch
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
obs, _ = env.reset()
hidden_state = model.init_hidden(batch_size=1)

done = False
while not done:
    obs_tensor = torch.tensor(obs, dtype=torch.float32).unsqueeze(0)
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        action_logits, hidden_state = model(obs_tensor, hidden_state)
    
    # Get action (first 2 dimensions are action logits)
    action = torch.argmax(action_logits[:, :2], dim=-1).item()
    obs, reward, done, truncated, info = env.step(action)
```

### 3. Test-Time Adaptation

The model supports **hybrid adaptation** using the experience buffer:

```python
from adaptation import HybridAdapter, HybridAdaptationConfig
from experience.experience_buffer import ExperienceBuffer

# Initialize experience buffer
experience_buffer = ExperienceBuffer(max_size=10000)

# Configure hybrid adapter
config = HybridAdaptationConfig(
    adapt_lr=0.01,
    num_adapt_steps=10,
    experience_weight=0.5
)

adapter = HybridAdapter(config)

# Adapt to new task
adapted_model = adapter.adapt(model, current_data, experience_buffer)
```
