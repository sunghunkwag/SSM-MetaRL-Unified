## üöÄ Overview & Key Innovation

**SSM-MetaRL-Unified** is a cutting-edge framework that integrates two powerful concepts in reinforcement learning:

1.  **`SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute`**: A robust baseline for meta-learning with State Space Models (SSM) and test-time adaptation, proven on high-dimensional SOTA benchmarks.
2.  **`EAML-SSM`**: An innovative approach for **Experience-Augmented Meta-Learning**, which enhances adaptation by replaying past experiences.

This unified repository merges these two projects, allowing researchers to seamlessly switch between **standard adaptation** and **experience-augmented (hybrid) adaptation**. The core innovation is the ability to leverage an `ExperienceBuffer` to regularize and guide adaptation, leading to more robust and sample-efficient learning, especially in sparse or non-stationary environments.

### Core Features

-   **State Space Models (SSM)**: For efficient and powerful temporal dynamics modeling.
-   **Meta-Learning (MAML)**: For rapid adaptation to new tasks.
-   **Dual Adaptation Modes**: 
    -   `standard`: Classic test-time adaptation using only current task data.
    -   `hybrid`: **Experience-augmented adaptation** using a hybrid loss that combines current data with past experiences from a replay buffer.
-   **Modular & Extensible**: Cleanly separated modules for models, meta-learning, adaptation, and experience replay.
-   **SOTA Benchmarks**: Includes high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks to validate performance against baselines like LSTM, GRU, and Transformer.
-   **Colab Integration**: An interactive demo notebook to explore the framework's capabilities without local installation.

## üîß Unified Architecture

The integration combines the strengths of both original repositories into a single, cohesive structure. The key changes are:

-   **`experience` Module**: The `ExperienceBuffer` from `EAML-SSM` is now a core module, enabling the storage and sampling of past trajectories.
-   **Refactored `adaptation` Module**: The adaptation logic is split into two distinct classes:
    -   `StandardAdapter`: Performs adaptation using only current task data (from `SSM-MetaRL-TestCompute`).
    -   `HybridAdapter`: Implements experience-augmented adaptation by combining current loss with a loss computed on a batch of past experiences (from `EAML-SSM`).
-   **Unified `main.py` and `serious_benchmark.py`**: Both scripts now include an `--adaptation_mode` flag, allowing you to easily switch between `standard` and `hybrid` modes.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the unified repository
git clone https://github.com/sunghunkwag/SSM-MetaRL-Unified.git
cd SSM-MetaRL-Unified

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .

# For development (including testing dependencies)
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Running the Main Script

The `main.py` script allows you to test both adaptation modes on a simple environment like `CartPole-v1`.

**1. Standard Adaptation (Baseline)**

This mode uses only the data from the current episode for adaptation.

```bash
python main.py --env_name CartPole-v1 --adaptation_mode standard --num_epochs 10
```

**2. Hybrid Adaptation (Experience-Augmented)**

This mode enhances adaptation by replaying past experiences from the buffer. The `--buffer_size` and `--experience_weight` flags control this behavior.

```bash
python main.py --env_name CartPole-v1 --adaptation_mode hybrid --num_epochs 10 --buffer_size 5000 --experience_weight 0.2
```

### Running the Integration Tests

We have included a new test script to verify that all integrated components work correctly.

```bash
python test_integration.py
```

This will run a series of tests to confirm:
-   The `ExperienceBuffer` functions correctly.
-   The `StandardAdapter` runs without errors.
-   The `HybridAdapter` runs and utilizes the experience buffer.

## üèÜ SOTA Benchmarking

The `serious_benchmark.py` script has been updated to support both adaptation modes, allowing for a direct comparison of their effectiveness on challenging, high-dimensional tasks.

### Prerequisites

To run the MuJoCo-based benchmarks, you need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install 'gymnasium[mujoco]'
```

### Running Benchmarks

**1. Standard Adaptation Benchmark**

```bash
python experiments/serious_benchmark.py \
    --task halfcheetah-vel \
    --method ssm \
    --adaptation_mode standard \
    --epochs 50
```

**2. Hybrid Adaptation Benchmark**

Compare the performance with experience replay enabled.

```bash
python experiments/serious_benchmark.py \
    --task halfcheetah-vel \
    --method ssm \
    --adaptation_mode hybrid \
    --epochs 50 \
    --buffer_size 20000 \
    --experience_weight 0.1
```

### Expected Outcome

By comparing the results from these two runs, you can quantify the benefits of experience-augmented adaptation. We expect the `hybrid` mode to show improved sample efficiency and final performance, especially in tasks where learning from scratch during test-time is difficult.

## üî¨ Core Components Explained

### `ExperienceBuffer`

-   **Location**: `experience/experience_buffer.py`
-   **Function**: A circular buffer that stores `(observation, target)` pairs from past trajectories.
-   **API**:
    -   `add(observations, targets)`: Adds new experiences to the buffer.
    -   `get_batch(batch_size)`: Samples a random batch of past experiences.

### `HybridAdapter`

-   **Location**: `adaptation/hybrid_adapter.py`
-   **Function**: Performs test-time adaptation using a **hybrid loss**.
-   **Mechanism**: The total loss is a weighted sum of the loss on the **current data** and the loss on a **batch of past experiences** sampled from the `ExperienceBuffer`. 

    ```python
    # Simplified hybrid loss calculation
    loss_current = self.loss_fn(output_current, y_current)
    
    experience_batch = self.experience_buffer.get_batch(...)
    if experience_batch is not None:
        x_exp, y_exp = experience_batch
        output_exp, _ = self.model(x_exp, ...)
        loss_experience = self.loss_fn(output_exp, y_exp)
        
        # Combine losses
        total_loss = loss_current + self.config.experience_weight * loss_experience
    ```

### Command-Line Arguments

This unified framework introduces several new arguments to control the adaptation process:

-   `--adaptation_mode`: `[standard, hybrid]` - Selects the adaptation strategy.
-   `--buffer_size`: `int` - The maximum number of experiences to store in the buffer.
-   `--experience_batch_size`: `int` - The number of past experiences to sample for each hybrid update.
-   `--experience_weight`: `float` - The weight (alpha) applied to the experience-based loss component.
