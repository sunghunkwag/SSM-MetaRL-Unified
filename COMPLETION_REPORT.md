## 🔧 App.py Modifications

### New Features Added

**1. Pre-trained Model Loading Function**

```python
def load_pretrained_model():
    """
    Load the pre-trained SSM-MetaRL model
    Returns: (model, experience_buffer, logs)
    """
    model = StateSpaceModel(
        state_dim=32,
        input_dim=4,
        output_dim=4,
        hidden_dim=64
    )
    
    # Load pre-trained weights
    model.load("cartpole_hybrid_real_model.pth")
    model.eval()
    
    return model, experience_buffer, logs
```

**2. New Tab: "Load Pre-trained Model"**

- One-click model loading
- Automatic weight loading from `.pth` file
- Status display and verification
- Quick start instructions

**3. Enhanced User Experience**

- **Before:** Users must wait 5-10 minutes for meta-training
- **After:** Users can load and test in < 10 seconds

### Interface Structure
